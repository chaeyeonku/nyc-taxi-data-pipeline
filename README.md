# NYC Taxi Data Pipeline: Transforming Trips with Python and Prefect
Transforming and analyzing New York City taxi trip data using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Prefect for automated data processing and analysis.

## Summary
The NYC Taxi Data Pipeline project is a data engineering project aimed at transforming and analyzing New York City taxi trip data using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Prefect. The project involves building an end-to-end data processing pipeline that ingests raw taxi trip data, performs data cleaning, feature engineering, and aggregation using Pandas and NumPy, and orchestrates the execution of data processing tasks with Prefect.

## Data Source:
- [NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Records](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)

## Key Features:

- Data Ingestion: Retrieve and ingest New York City taxi trip data from public datasets.
- Data Transformation: Clean, filter, and aggregate taxi trip data using Pandas and NumPy for analysis.
- Workflow Orchestration: Schedule and automate the execution of data processing tasks with Prefect.
- Modularity and Scalability: Divide the pipeline into modular tasks for better organization and scalability.
- Fault Tolerance: Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for fault tolerance and reliability.
- Monitoring and Logging: Log task outputs and monitor pipeline execution for observability and troubleshooting.

## Objective:
The objective of the project is to demonstrate proficiency in building data processing pipelines for real-world datasets, showcasing skills in data transformation, workflow orchestration, and pipeline automation. By completing this project, I aim to gain practical experience in data engineering and contribute to the open-source community by sharing the project code and documentation on GitHub.
